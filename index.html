        <h2>City students save lives of children with heart diseases.</h2>
         A couple of weeks ago, students of Vidyaniketan School in Hebbal participated in a unique social campaign, which was about more than donating clothes or stationery for the less privileged. Students from Class 10 to 12 kickstarted a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for pediatric heart surgeries. “We were intrigued by the workshop conducted by Ranganathan Thota, who is the founder of the crowdfunding platform, FuelADream, and it was then that we realised the need for financial assistance for families of children requiring heart surgeries,” says 17-year-old, Mohammed Amaan Asim, a Class 12 student, adding, “We realised that crowdfunding was a cost-effective way to reduce the financial burden of such families.”
But what took the kids by surprise is the overwhelming response to their intiative, when they managed to raise Rs 10 lakh in less than 48 hours, which grew to Rs 24 lakh in the next few days. The students are hopeful of putting together a tidy sum by the end of the campaign this month. Close to 72 students have participated in the campaign that is set to help facilitate close to 90 pediatric surgeries at the government-run Jayadeva Hospital. The goal, they say, was to have each participant raise Rs 30,000, but many students outdid themselves. For instance, Shreya Mittal, a Class 10 student, raised Rs 1,62,000 and her message to the contributors on the platform read, “With your help, I want to save a needy child suffering from a heart ailment. Help me with a BIG HEART.”

        <h4>Bengaluru School’s 2019 Resolutions Are Creating Better Kids!</h4>
         It is one thing to be taught something and a completely different thing to be encouraged to put that learning into practice.

Vidya Niketan, a school based in Hebbal, Bengaluru, has started a rather unique initiative, which encourages students, teachers, and parents to spend 40 hours in 2019 towards community development.

In a conversation with The Better India, Mrs H Vithani, the founder of the school, tells us how this idea came into being.“I had heard about a tech giant in the city giving its employees 40 hours of leave to enable them to participate in community development programmes. Given that in schools, we already have enough holidays, I modified the plan to suit our needs,” she begins.

Every member of the school, whether teaching staff or administrative, students or support staff, are participating in this unique resolution.
